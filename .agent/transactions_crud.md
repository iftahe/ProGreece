title: Implement Transactions CRUD Frontend Logic
status: in_progress
notes: |
  User requested to proceed with Transactions CRUD implementation with Hard Delete.
  Backend already supports Create, Read, Update, Delete.
  Frontend has UI buttons but likely lacks logic.
todo:
  - Read frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx to assess current state.
  - Implement handleDelete function in Frontend to call DELETE API.
  - Implement handleEdit function to populate the form.
  - Update form submission logic to switch between Create (POST) and Update (PUT).
  - Add "Cancel" button when in Edit mode.
  - Verify Hard Delete behavior (already validated in backend code).
